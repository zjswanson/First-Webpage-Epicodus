# _My-First-Webpage_  


#### _Introductory webpage projects created as part of day one at Epicodus_

#### _**created by Zach Swanson and Stephanie Spears**_



## _Project contains two html files: My-First-Webpage, our "hello world" which links to our other projects from the day, and Favorite-Things, a page built to practice writing lists and including inline images._


##  Setup and Installation:
* _Run these html files in the browser of your choice_


## Known Bugs

_We have not learned how to add any functionality or interactivity, so these pages are markedly boring.  And the photos are not cropped very evenly_

## Support and Contact


_Questions or concerns can be directed to zach.j.swanson@gmail.com_

## Technologies used

_Created in Atom text editor in HTML5.  Also used a funky ergonomic keyboard to increase spelling error frequency._
